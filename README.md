# üß¨ Automatic Leukemia Image Detection

## üß† Problem Statement

Leukemia, specifically Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), is a serious blood cancer that requires early detection for effective treatment. This project uses deep learning to classify blood cell images as either:
- `ALL`: Leukemic cells
- `HEM`: Healthy/normal cells

Our goal is to build an automated diagnostic tool that can support early leukemia detection from microscopic images.

## üìÇ Dataset

- üìå **Source**: [Kaggle - Leukemia Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/leukemia-classification)
- üí° **Contents**:
  - Labeled cell images: `ALL` (leukemia) and `HEM` (healthy)
  - Divided into training, validation, and test sets
- üîÑ Format: RGB image files

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Import and Preprocessing**:
   - Downloaded via Kaggle CLI
   - Resized images to 200x200
   - Optionally converted to grayscale
   - Checked class balance and image counts

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized distribution of classes
   - Displayed sample images for visual understanding

3. **Model Building**:
   - Baseline CNN model built using Keras
   - Configurable parameters: learning rate, batch size, epochs
   - Option to run on reduced dataset for low memory environments

4. **Training & Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, loss curves plotted
   - Confusion matrix and classification report for validation results

5. **Result Visualization**:
   - Bar plots of class distribution
   - Performance metrics visualized
   - Saved trained model for future use

## üìà Results

The project evaluated several classification models on leukemia image data. Below is a comparison of model performance on the test set:

| Model                       | Accuracy | Balanced Accuracy | ROC AUC | F1 Score | Time Taken (s) |
|----------------------------|----------|-------------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| SVC                        | **0.88** | **0.82**          | **0.82**| **0.87** | 94.63          |
| XGBClassifier              | 0.86     | 0.81              | 0.81    | 0.86     | 292.92         |
| Linear Discriminant Analysis | 0.85  | 0.81              | 0.81    | 0.85     | 18.73          |
| RidgeClassifierCV          | 0.85     | 0.81              | 0.81    | 0.85     | 15.88          |
| RidgeClassifier            | 0.85     | 0.81              | 0.81    | 0.85     | **1.46**       |

üîç **Best Overall Model**:  
- **SVC** achieved the highest accuracy (**88%**) and F1 score (**0.87**), making it the top-performing model in terms of classification quality.

üïí **Fastest Model**:  
- **RidgeClassifier** trained in just **1.46 seconds** while still achieving a strong F1 score (**0.85**), making it a great choice for speed-critical applications.
